// One file per area, under sections/. This file is only the runner: what runs,
// in what order, and what failed. Everything they share — the stubs, the
// fixtures, the loaded bundle, and the state the tests move — is in helpers.js.
//
// The order matters in one place. The tests run against the *bundled* plugin,
// which starts fetching the gallery map as it loads, so the sections that read
// what it fetched run in a timer afterwards. Run `pnpm test` from the repository
// root, which builds first: what is loaded is dist/, so the tests read exactly
// what gets published and a broken build shows up here.

/**
 * Manga Tools — language table
 *
 * Pure data plus pure functions. No dependency on PluginApi, no DOM.
 *
 * This is a module now that the plugin is bundled (esbuild — see
 * build.mjs), so mangaTools.tsx imports it rather than reaching through
 * the window. It still publishes itself at window.MangaTools as well: that is
 * the handle the smoke tests use to call these functions directly, and keeping
 * one stable entry point is cheaper than teaching the tests to reach inside a
 * bundle.
 *
 * The approach mirrors how Stash handles performer nationality:
 *   store a canonical code → look up a localised name when rendering →
 *   fall back to showing the raw value
 * (see ui/v2.5/src/utils/country.ts and CountryLabel.tsx in the Stash repo)
 *
 * Two things differ from nationality:
 *   1. Values are only ever written by this plugin's own dropdown, so the table
 *      holds canonical codes only — there is no alias mapping. If a value ever
 *      does not match, it surfaces as a grey "unrecognised" chip rather than
 *      being silently corrected.
 *   2. Languages have no flag, so each one is paired with a **regional flag**
 *      (a flag-icons alpha-2 *country* code). That mapping is lossy — a language
 *      is not a country. See the per-entry notes below.
 *
 * NOTE: the strings inside `names` below are display data, not comments. They
 * are the whole point of the localisation — do not translate them.

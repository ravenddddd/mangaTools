/**
 * Manga Tools — a toolbox that adapts Stash galleries to manga/comic management.
 *
 * Everything goes through the UI plugin API; no Stash core code is modified, so
 * Stash upgrades never produce merge conflicts.
 *
 * The language attribute lives in one of the Gallery's custom fields,
 * `plugin.mangaTools.language`. What is stored is the canonical code, not the
 * display name, and the name is looked up only when rendering — the same
 * approach Stash takes for performer nationality. It surfaces in five places:
 *
 *   - a flag badge on the bottom of the gallery card cover
 *   - a dropdown on the gallery edit page, so you never type a code by hand
 *   - the same dropdown in the bulk edit dialog, gated by the manga mark and
 *     riding along with Apply
 *   - a collapsible block in the details tab, where the raw code would be — the
 *     language as its flag and localised name, the censorship mark beside it
 *   - a filter section in the gallery list's sidebar (sidebar-filter.tsx),
 *     which narrows the list to one language
 *
 * A second attribute, the censorship mark, works the same way and lives in
 * `plugin.mangaTools.censorship`. It is a two-valued field rather than a boolean:
 * "not marked" is the absence of the key, which is what the selector's own clear
 * button produces. It surfaces in three places:
 *
 *   - a selector on the gallery edit page, beside the language one
 *   - a row in the details tab's block, as icon and word
 *   - a selector in the bulk edit dialog, gated the same way
 *
 * A third field decides whether any of it applies. A gallery carrying
 * `plugin.mangaTools.manga` is manga; one that does not is an ordinary Stash
 * gallery, and the only thing of this plugin's on it is the switch that sets the
 * mark. Everything above is drawn only on the first kind — and the card carries
 * that same mark's icon at the end of its popover row, which is what says which
 * kind a card is without opening anything.
 *
 * `languages.ts` holds the codes and their flags, `censorship.tsx` the
 * censorship vocabulary and its icons, `fields.ts` the field names and the
 * generic read/write helpers. Filtering is spread across four modules —
 * `filter-model.ts` the criterion read/write logic, `filter-ui.tsx` the rows
 * both surfaces share, `sidebar-filter.tsx` the three sidebar sections, and
 * `dialog-filter.tsx` the dialog's language card. Everything else is below.
 *
 * New features should keep the same shape: patches that hand anything they do
 * not own straight back to the original component, and shared data in a module
 * rather than on the window.
 *
 * The plugin is one bundled file. The modules imported below are inlined into
 * it, so Stash loads exactly the one file ui.javascript names in mangaTools.yml
 * and there is no load order left to get wrong.

  // The translation group, wearing the same Select as the two fields above it —
  // which is a costume, because react-select cannot be typed into. What makes it
  // work is that **the text in the box is the field's value**: every keystroke is
  // written to the map as it is typed, exactly as the plain text box did, and the
  // menu is then built from the value rather than from any state of react-select's.
  //
  // That is what keeps it honest. react-select is a control for choosing from a
  // list, and the usual way to make it accept new text is to keep the search text
  // in state, offer it as an extra option, and hope the reader selects it — where
  // typing and then leaving throws the text away. Here there is nothing to throw
  // away: the value is already saved, and the "create" entry is a way of saying
  // "this text, yes" rather than the only way of keeping it.
  //
  // Two of react-select's behaviours have to be worked with rather than around,
  // and both are visible in its source (Select.js, "renderPlaceholderOrValue" and
  // "setValue"):
  //
  //   - The value area draws **nothing** while the input has text in it, because
  //     the input is then assumed to be showing that text; and choosing an option
  //     hides the input (`opacity: 0`) for a single select. So `inputValue` is left
  //     to react-select: it holds what is being typed, the box shows that while
  //     typing and the chosen name as plain text afterwards, and the field ends up
  //     behaving exactly like the two above it. Controlling `inputValue` to the
  //     value instead blanks the box — text hidden and no label drawn.
  //   - `onInputChange` fires for reasons other than typing — selecting, closing
  //     the menu — and its text is then the option's label or nothing at all.
  //     Taking it would put the search text back over the value just chosen, or
  //     clear the field as the menu closed. Only "input-change" is written.

 * pending edits in its own useState, so there is no way to add a field to them.
 * The rows therefore live outside that state and their values are merged into
 * the outgoing mutation instead — see installBulkLink.
 *
 * `null` means "leave the field alone". A select's ✗ clears back to null; its
 * "remove" option is the only way to empty a field across a whole selection.
 * The two are deliberately distinct — "do not change" and "delete" are not the
 * same thing, and a bulk dialog that could only do the first would be unable to
 * strip a value Stash's own edit form can clear.
 *
 * `bulkManga` is the master. The mark is what makes a gallery the plugin's at
 * all, so the other two rows are only drawn while it is "mark"; and "unmark"
 * wins over whatever they hold, because a gallery that stops being manga also
 * stops carrying their values. See selectedMangaAggregate for the three states.
 *
 * All three are dropped once the mutation succeeds and when the dialog closes,
 * so a cancelled dialog leaves nothing behind.

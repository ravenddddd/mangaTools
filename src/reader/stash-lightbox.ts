/**
 * What this plugin knows about Stash's lightbox: its markup, how to read where it
 * is, how to move it, and how to fetch the pages it is showing.
 *
 * Every name in here is an assumption about a component Stash does not expose —
 * `LightboxComponent` is a plain `React.FC` with no `PatchComponent` wrapper, so
 * there is no supported way in and this is the boundary where that is admitted.
 * Keeping the assumptions in one file is what makes them checkable against
 * Stash's source, and what the test suite can pin the parts of that are pure
 * (`parseIndicator`, `galleryIdFromPath`).
 *
 * If Stash renames something here, the reader stops working — so everything that
 * reads the lightbox returns null rather than guessing, and the caller turns the
 * mode off. A reader that cannot tell where it is must not draw anything.

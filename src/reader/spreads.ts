/**
 * Manga Reader — how a gallery's pages go together into screens.
 *
 * Pure data plus pure functions: no PluginApi, no DOM. The smoke tests call these
 * directly, and that is the reason they live in a file of their own — the reader
 * that consumes them is DOM surgery inside Stash's own lightbox, and a test that
 * had to drive *that* would be testing Stash's markup rather than the pairing.
 *
 * READING ORDER, NOT VISUAL ORDER. A screen's `pages` come in the order they are
 * read: `pages[0]` is the earlier page. In a right-to-left book the earlier page
 * is drawn on the *right*, so the reader reverses them as it lays them out.
 * Keeping direction out of this file means the rules have no direction in them to
 * get wrong — and a western comic would be the same rules with the reversing done
 * the other way round.
